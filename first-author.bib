  abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats [CRISPR]-CRISPR associated proteins [Cas]) system can provide prokaryote with immunity against invading mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as phages and plasmids, which are the main sources of staphylococcal accessory genes. To date, only a few Staphylococcus aureus strains containing CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, but no functional study in these strains has been reported. In this study, 6 clinical isolates of S. aureus with type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, and whole-genome sequencing and functional study were conducted subsequently. Genome sequence analysis revealed a close linkage between the CRISPR-Cas system and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element in five strains. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the type III-A repeats are conserved within staphylococci, despite of the decreased conservation in trailer-end repeats. Highly homologous sequences of some spacers were identified in staphylococcal MGEs, and partially complementary sequences of spacers were mostly found in the coding strand of lytic regions in staphylococcal phages. Transformation experiments showed that S. aureus type III-A CRISPR-Cas system can specifically prevent plasmid transfer in a transcription-dependent manner. Base paring between crRNA and target sequence, the endoribonuclease, and the Csm complex were proved to be necessary for type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation plays a critical role during the infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. A two-component system, PhoPR, is clearly involved in the regulation of pathogenic virulence and persistence. However, the regulatory mechanism, as well as the regulator, of the phoPR operon remains uncharacterized in M. tuberculosis and its related species thus far. In the present study, we characterize an ArsR transcriptional factor, corresponding to Rv2034 and Ms6762 in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, as the first regulator of phoP in both mycobacterial species. The interaction between ArsR regulator and target promoters is conserved in these two mycobacterial species, and an inverted repeat sequence motif is successfully mapped out for the recognition of ArsR. Utilizing lacZ reporter genes and overexpression analysis, the ArsR regulator is shown to positively regulate the expression of phoP in M. smegmatis, different from most ArsR family regulators generally as a repressor. The current study establishes a direct link between the ArsR transcriptional factor and the regulation of phoP in mycobacteria. Our findings imply that ArsR may be involved in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through its regulation of the phoPR operon.},

However, the biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics. As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to the discovery of new antibiotics.},

In this study, interactions between two representative resident species (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida) and a leading food-borne disease causative pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were examined. An antagonistic effect toward V. parahaemolyticus was observed for B. subtilis but not for P. putida. However, the relative richness of the pathogen remained rather high in B. subtilis co-cultures and was, unexpectedly, not sensitive to the initial inoculation ratios. Furthermore, two approaches were found to be efficient at modulating the relative richness of the pathogen. (1) The addition of trace glycerol and manganese to Luria-Bertani medium (LBGM) reduced the richness of V. parahaemolyticus in the co-culture with B. subtilis and in contrast, increased its richness in the co-culture with P. putida, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus by its own. (2) The relative richness of V. parahaemolyticus on semisolid medium decreased significantly as a function of an agar gradient, ranging from 0 to 2\%. Furthermore, we explored the molecular basis of bacterial interaction through transcriptomic analysis. In summary, we investigated the interactions between a pathogen invader and two resident bacteria species, showing that the different influences on a pathogen by different types of interactions can be modulated by chemicals and medium fluidity.},

We thus conducted a time-series transcriptional analysis of a convergent two-species synthetic community that grew in a closed broth-culture system. By analyzing the gene expression and monitoring the community structure, we found that gene expression mainly changed in the early stage, whereas community structure significantly changed in the late stage. The significant change of gene expression occurred even at the very beginning, which was designated as ``0\,h effect'', suggesting the effect of species interaction on gene expression was inevitable. Besides, the effect of interaction on gene expression has a ``population effect'', which means that majority species have greater impact on gene expressions of minority species than vice versa. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that among a total of 63 unique pathways (occupying about 50\% of all the metabolic pathways in both species), 40 (63\%) were consistently suppressed, 16 (25\%) were conditionally expressed, and only 7 (11\%) were consistently activated. Overall, they were strictly regulated by both time and initial structures. Therefore, we proposed that microorganism responses and the induced gene expression changes play important roles in the process of community succession.},

Prior results showed that several types of NPs inhibited PCR efficiency and increased amplicon error frequency. In this study, we examined the effects of various metal oxide NPs on inhibiting PCR, using high- vs. low-fidelity DNA polymerases; we also examined NP-induced DNA mutation bias at the single nucleotide level. The effects of seven major types of metal oxide NPs (Fe2O3, ZnO, CeO2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) on PCR replication via a low-fidelity DNA polymerase (Ex Taq) and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) were tested. The successfully amplified PCR products were subsequently sequenced using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Using consistent proportions of NPs and DNA, we found that the effects of NPs on PCR yield differed depending on the DNA polymerase. Specifically, the efficiency of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) was significantly inhibited by NPs during PCR; such inhibition was not evident in reactions with Ex Taq. Amplicon sequencing showed that the overall error rate of NP-amended PCR was not significantly different from that of PCR without NPs (p {$>$} 0.05), and NPs did not introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms during PCR. Thus, overall, NPs inhibited PCR amplification in a DNA polymerase-specific manner, but mutations were not introduced in the process.},

As a key experimental parameter, the initial inoculation ratio has a crucial impact on the results of the coculture system.

In this study, we established a simple coculture system with two model bacteria in various carbon sources and investigated the influence of initial inoculum ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1 on community structure, function, and bacterial interaction. We found that the final ratio of the cocultures with different initial inoculum ratios differed in approximately five-sixths of the carbon sources, suggesting that the final ratio is highly dependent on the initial inoculum ratio, while the carbon source preferences of bacteria could not predict the final ratio of cocultures. Furthermore, we found that the initial ratio could regulate the metabolic capacity of the coculture, as only cocultures with initial ratios of 1:1 and 1000:1 gained high capacity on 14 specific carbon sources. The underlying reason may be that the pattern of species interaction is changed by the initial ratio. In conclusion, we showed that the initial ratio can induce emergent properties in coculture. These findings suggest that the initial ratio not only impacts the reproducibility of coculture experiments but also can influence our understanding of generic microbial ecology.},

The genome houses 44 gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, in which 20 gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides and nonribosomally synthesized peptides. High-throughput sequencing was further performed and genetic variants were identified from pooled libraries consisting of the 30 highest-yield mutants or 30 lowest-yield mutants. More than 350 genetic variants associated with {$\epsilon$}-PL yield have been identified. One hundred sixty-two affected proteins, from important metabolic enzymes to novel transcriptional regulators, were identified as being related to {$\epsilon$}-PL synthesis. HrdD, one of the affected genes, is a sigma factor that shows the most sensitive response to pH change and contains a non-synonymous mutation (A132V) in mutant strains with lower {$\epsilon$}-PL yields. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the pls gene is likely regulated by transcriptional activator HrdD. The data obtained in this study will facilitate future studies on {$\epsilon$}-PL yield improvement and industrial bioprocess optimization.},

However, the pathway through which Mycobacterium tuberculosis responds INH remain largely unclear. In this study, we characterized a novel transcriptional factor, InbR, which is encoded by Rv0275c and belongs to the TetR family, that is directly responsive to INH. Disrupting inbR made mycobacteria more sensitive to INH, whereas overexpressing inbR decreased bacterial susceptibility to the drug. InbR could bind specifically to the upstream region of its own operon at two inverted repeats and act as an auto-repressor. Furthermore, InbR directly bind with INH, and the binding reduced InbR's DNA-binding ability. Interestingly, susceptibilities were also changed by InbR for other anti-TB drugs, such as rifampin, implying that InbR may play a role in multi-drug resistance. Additionally, microarray analyses revealed a portion genes of the inbR regulon have similar expression patterns in inbR-overexpressing strain and INH-treated wild type strain, suggesting that these genes, for example iniBAC, may be responsible to the drug resistance of inbR-overexpressing strain. The regulation of these genes by InbR were further assessed by ChIP-seq assay. InbR may regulate multiple drug resistance of mycobacteria through the regulation of these genes.},

In this study, a TetR family transcriptional factor (OxiR), encoded by Rv0067c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was found to be an isoniazid (INH) resistance regulator. Comparing with the wild-type strain, the oxiR overexpressing strain is four times resistant to INH, whereas the oxiR knockout strain is eight times sensitive to INH. However, the rifamycin and ethambutol resistance were not influenced by oxiR. OxiR can bind to self-promoter at a 66 bp imperfect palindromic motifs. Interestingly, OxiR directly binds to INH, and thereby alleviate the self-repression. Furthermore, OxiR negatively regulated an oxidoreductase encoded by Rv0068. And the susceptibility of the Rv0068-overexpressing and oxiR knockout strains to all the three above-mentioned anti-tuberculosis drugs was equivalent, suggesting that the effect of oxiR to INH susceptibility is attributed to the derepression of Rv0068. In conclusion, we showed that OxiR can specifically modulate INH susceptibility by regulating an oxidoreductase encoding gene, both of which have not been associated with drug-resistance previously.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation plays a critical role in the life cycle of Mycobacterium smegmatis and its related species, M. tuberculosis, the causative microbe for tuberculosis. However, the key transcriptional factors involved in broad regulation of diverse genes remain to be characterized in mycobacteria. In the present study, a TetR-like family transcriptional factor, Ms6564, was characterized in M. smegmatis as a master regulator. A conserved 19 bp-palindromic motif was identified for Ms6564 binding using DNaseI footprinting and EMSA. A total of 339 potential target genes for Ms6564 were further characterized by searching the M. smegmatis genome based on the sequence motif. Notably, Ms6564 bound with the promoters of 37 cell cycle and DNA damage/repair genes and regulated positively their expressions. The Ms6564-overexpressed recombinant strain yielded 5-fold lower mutation rates and mutation frequencies, whereas deletion of Ms6564 resulted in {$\sim$}5-fold higher mutation rates for the mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain. These findings suggested that Ms6564 may function as a global regulator and might be a sensor necessary for activation of DNA damage/repair genes.},
