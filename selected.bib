  abstract = {Soil is inhabited by a myriad of microorganisms, many of which can form supracellular structures, called biofilms, comprised of surface-associated microbial cells embedded in hydrated extracellular polymeric substance that facilitates adhesion and survival. Biofilms enable intensive inter- and intra-species interactions that can increase the degradation efficiency of soil organic matter and materials commonly regarded as toxins. Here, we first discuss organization, dynamics and properties of soil biofilms in the context of traditional approaches to probe the soil microbiome. Social interactions among bacteria, such as cooperation and competition, are discussed. We also summarize different biofilm cultivation devices in combination with optics and fluorescence microscopes as well as sequencing techniques for the study of soil biofilms. Microfluidic platforms, which can be applied to mimic the complex soil environment and study microbial behaviors at the microscale with high-throughput screening and novel measurements, are also highlighted. This review aims to highlight soil biofilm research in order to expand the current limited knowledge about soil microbiomes which until now has mostly ignored biofilms as a dominant growth form.},

To date, only a few Staphylococcus aureus strains containing CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, but no functional study in these strains has been reported. In this study, 6 clinical isolates of S. aureus with type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, and whole-genome sequencing and functional study were conducted subsequently. Genome sequence analysis revealed a close linkage between the CRISPR-Cas system and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element in five strains. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the type III-A repeats are conserved within staphylococci, despite of the decreased conservation in trailer-end repeats. Highly homologous sequences of some spacers were identified in staphylococcal MGEs, and partially complementary sequences of spacers were mostly found in the coding strand of lytic regions in staphylococcal phages. Transformation experiments showed that S. aureus type III-A CRISPR-Cas system can specifically prevent plasmid transfer in a transcription-dependent manner. Base paring between crRNA and target sequence, the endoribonuclease, and the Csm complex were proved to be necessary for type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation plays a critical role during the infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. A two-component system, PhoPR, is clearly involved in the regulation of pathogenic virulence and persistence. However, the regulatory mechanism, as well as the regulator, of the phoPR operon remains uncharacterized in M. tuberculosis and its related species thus far. In the present study, we characterize an ArsR transcriptional factor, corresponding to Rv2034 and Ms6762 in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, as the first regulator of phoP in both mycobacterial species. The interaction between ArsR regulator and target promoters is conserved in these two mycobacterial species, and an inverted repeat sequence motif is successfully mapped out for the recognition of ArsR. Utilizing lacZ reporter genes and overexpression analysis, the ArsR regulator is shown to positively regulate the expression of phoP in M. smegmatis, different from most ArsR family regulators generally as a repressor. The current study establishes a direct link between the ArsR transcriptional factor and the regulation of phoP in mycobacteria. Our findings imply that ArsR may be involved in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through its regulation of the phoPR operon.},

We also provide evidence that Rv2034 forms dimers in vitro. Furthermore, by using DNaseI footprinting assays, a palindromic sequence was identified as its binding site.

  abstract = {Bacterial natural products (NPs) are considered to be a promising source of drug discovery. However, the biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics. As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to the discovery of new antibiotics.},

In this study, interactions between two representative resident species (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida) and a leading food-borne disease causative pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were examined. An antagonistic effect toward V. parahaemolyticus was observed for B. subtilis but not for P. putida. However, the relative richness of the pathogen remained rather high in B. subtilis co-cultures and was, unexpectedly, not sensitive to the initial inoculation ratios. Furthermore, two approaches were found to be efficient at modulating the relative richness of the pathogen. (1) The addition of trace glycerol and manganese to Luria-Bertani medium (LBGM) reduced the richness of V. parahaemolyticus in the co-culture with B. subtilis and in contrast, increased its richness in the co-culture with P. putida, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus by its own. (2) The relative richness of V. parahaemolyticus on semisolid medium decreased significantly as a function of an agar gradient, ranging from 0 to 2\%. Furthermore, we explored the molecular basis of bacterial interaction through transcriptomic analysis. In summary, we investigated the interactions between a pathogen invader and two resident bacteria species, showing that the different influences on a pathogen by different types of interactions can be modulated by chemicals and medium fluidity.},

  abstract = {Taxonomic convergence is common in bacterial communities but its underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. We thus conducted a time-series transcriptional analysis of a convergent two-species synthetic community that grew in a closed broth-culture system. By analyzing the gene expression and monitoring the community structure, we found that gene expression mainly changed in the early stage, whereas community structure significantly changed in the late stage. The significant change of gene expression occurred even at the very beginning, which was designated as ``0\,h effect'', suggesting the effect of species interaction on gene expression was inevitable. Besides, the effect of interaction on gene expression has a ``population effect'', which means that majority species have greater impact on gene expressions of minority species than vice versa. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that among a total of 63 unique pathways (occupying about 50\% of all the metabolic pathways in both species), 40 (63\%) were consistently suppressed, 16 (25\%) were conditionally expressed, and only 7 (11\%) were consistently activated. Overall, they were strictly regulated by both time and initial structures. Therefore, we proposed that microorganism responses and the induced gene expression changes play important roles in the process of community succession.},

The ggVennDiagram is built based on ggplot2, and it integrates the advantages of existing packages, such as venn, RVenn, VennDiagram, and sf. Satisfactory results can be obtained with minimal configurations. Furthermore, we designed comprehensive objects to store the entire data of the Venn diagram, which allowed free access to both intersection values and Venn plot sub-elements, such as set label/edge and region label/filling. Therefore, high customization of every Venn plot sub-element can be fulfilled without increasing the cost of learning when the user is familiar with ggplot2 methods. To date, ggVennDiagram has been cited in more than 10 publications, and its source code repository has been starred by more than 140 GitHub users, suggesting a great potential in applications.

In this study, we examined the effects of various metal oxide NPs on inhibiting PCR, using high- vs. low-fidelity DNA polymerases; we also examined NP-induced DNA mutation bias at the single nucleotide level. The effects of seven major types of metal oxide NPs (Fe2O3, ZnO, CeO2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) on PCR replication via a low-fidelity DNA polymerase (Ex Taq) and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) were tested. The successfully amplified PCR products were subsequently sequenced using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Using consistent proportions of NPs and DNA, we found that the effects of NPs on PCR yield differed depending on the DNA polymerase. Specifically, the efficiency of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) was significantly inhibited by NPs during PCR; such inhibition was not evident in reactions with Ex Taq. Amplicon sequencing showed that the overall error rate of NP-amended PCR was not significantly different from that of PCR without NPs (p {$>$} 0.05), and NPs did not introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms during PCR. Thus, overall, NPs inhibited PCR amplification in a DNA polymerase-specific manner, but mutations were not introduced in the process.},

As a key experimental parameter, the initial inoculation ratio has a crucial impact on the results of the coculture system. However, such an effect has never been investigated under multiple niche conditions. In this study, we established a simple coculture system with two model bacteria in various carbon sources and investigated the influence of initial inoculum ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1 on community structure, function, and bacterial interaction. We found that the final ratio of the cocultures with different initial inoculum ratios differed in approximately five-sixths of the carbon sources, suggesting that the final ratio is highly dependent on the initial inoculum ratio, while the carbon source preferences of bacteria could not predict the final ratio of cocultures. Furthermore, we found that the initial ratio could regulate the metabolic capacity of the coculture, as only cocultures with initial ratios of 1:1 and 1000:1 gained high capacity on 14 specific carbon sources. The underlying reason may be that the pattern of species interaction is changed by the initial ratio. In conclusion, we showed that the initial ratio can induce emergent properties in coculture. These findings suggest that the initial ratio not only impacts the reproducibility of coculture experiments but also can influence our understanding of generic microbial ecology.},

However, in lower prokaryotes and eukaryotic metazoans, it is usually difficult to find transcription regulatory factors that recognize specific target promoters. To address this, we have developed in this study a new bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector system that provides a convenient and rapid strategy to determine the specific interaction between target DNA sequences and their transcription factors. Using this system, we have successfully determined the DNA-binding specificity of the transcription regulator Rv3133c to a previously reported promoter region of the gene Rv2031 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we have tested more than 20 promoter regions of M. tuberculosis genes using this approach to determine if they interact with approximately 150 putative regulatory proteins. A variety of transcription factors are found to participate in the regulation of stress response and fatty acid metabolism, both of which comprise the core of in vivo-induced genes when M. tuberculosis invades macrophages. Interestingly, among the many new discovered potential transcription factors, the WhiB-like transcriptional factor WhiB3 was identified for the first time to bind with the promoter sequences of most in vivo-induced genes. Therefore, this study offers important data in the dissection of the transcription regulations in M. tuberculosis, and the strategy should be applicable in the study of DNA-binding factors in a wide range of biological organisms.},

The assembly of the abundant bacterial subcommunity was governed by stochastic (59.2\%) and deterministic (41.8\%) processes, whereas the assembly of the rare bacterial subcommunity was mainly dominated by deterministic process (85.8\%). Furthermore, total phosphorus, soil pH, and ammonium nitrogen balanced stochastic and deterministic processes in both rare and abundant bacterial subcommunities. Our results reveal that rare bacteria displayed stronger environmental adaptability and environmental constraint. Importantly, the {$\alpha$}-diversities of rare taxa, rather than abundant taxa, were significantly related to carbon decomposition. This study provides a holistic understanding of biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacteria and their {$\alpha$}-diversities in relation to carbon decomposition, thus helping us better predict and regulate carbon dynamics under the background of global climate change.},

  abstract = {Clay minerals and metal oxides, as important parts of the soil matrix, play crucial roles in the development of microbial communities. However, the mechanism underlying such a process, particularly on the formation of soil biofilm, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite on the biofilm formation of the representative soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial biofilm formation in goethite was found to be impaired in the initial 24\,h but burst at 48\,h in the liquid\textendash air interface. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm biomass in goethite was 3\textendash 16 times that of the control, montmorillonite, and kaolinite at 48\,h. Live/Dead staining showed that cells had the highest death rate of 60\% after 4\,h of contact with goethite, followed by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Atomic force microscopy showed that the interaction between goethite and bacteria may injure bacterial cells by puncturing cell wall, leading to the swarming of bacteria toward the liquid\textendash air interface. Additionally, the expressions of abrB and sinR, key players in regulating the biofilm formation, were upregulated at 24\,h and downregulated at 48\,h in goethite, indicating the initial adaptation of the cells to minerals. A model was proposed to describe the effects of goethite on the biofilm formation. Our findings may facilitate a better understanding of the roles of soil clays in biofilm development and the manipulation of bacterial compositions through controlling the biofilm in soils. The effect of three soil minerals on biofilm production is clarified by research using the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The mineral composition of soil is known to affect biofilm production, but the mechanisms underpinning minerals' influences have not been well studied. Peng Cai and colleagues at Huazhong Agricultural University in China, with co-workers in the United States and Singapore, studied Bacillus subtilis growing in the presence of the minerals montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite. Their results suggest the minerals, especially goethite, can encourage biofilm formation by promoting the bursting of bacterial cells. The effect of goethite was attributed to the size of its grains being generally smaller than the bacterial cells. By quantifying the effect of these minerals, the research will assist understanding of biofilm formation and the growth and persistence of bacterial populations in soils.},

  abstract = {Background Bacterial biofilms are surface-adherent microbial communities in which individual cells are surrounded by a self-produced extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins. Interactions among matrix components within biofilms are responsible for creating an adaptable structure during biofilm development. However, it is unclear how the interactions among matrix components contribute to the construction of the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architecture. Results DNase I treatment significantly inhibited Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation in the early phases of biofilm development. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis revealed that eDNA was cooperative with exopolysaccharide (EPS) in the early stages of B. subtilis biofilm development, while EPS played a major structural role in the later stages. In addition, deletion of the EPS production gene epsG in B. subtilis SBE1 resulted in loss of the interaction between EPS and eDNA and reduced the biofilm biomass in pellicles at the air-liquid interface. The physical interaction between these two essential biofilm matrix components was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Conclusions Biofilm 3D structures become interconnected through surrounding eDNA and EPS. eDNA interacts with EPS in the early phases of biofilm development, while EPS mainly participates in the maturation of biofilms. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the role of the interaction between eDNA and EPS in shaping the biofilm 3D matrix structure and biofilm formation.},

This study looks at the construction of a global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, based on a high-throughput bacterial two-hybrid method. Almost the entire ORFeome was cloned, and more than 8000 novel interactions were identified. The overall quality of the PPI network was validated through two independent methods, and a high success rate of more than 60\% was obtained. The parameters of PPI networks were calculated. The average shortest path length was 4.31. The topological coefficient of the M. tuberculosis B2H network perfectly followed a power law distribution (correlation = 0.999; R-squared = 0.999) and represented the best fit in all currently available PPI networks. A cross-species PPI network comparison revealed 94 conserved subnetworks between M. tuberculosis and several prokaryotic organism PPI networks. The global network was linked to the protein secretion pathway. Two WhiB-like regulators were found to be highly connected proteins in the global network. This is the first systematic noncomputational PPI data for the human pathogen, and it provides a useful resource for studies of infection mechanisms, new signaling pathways, and novel antituberculosis drug development.},

Here, we first obtained the complete genome sequence of S. albulus ZPM, which consists of 9,784,577\hspace{0.25em}bp and has a GC content of 72.2\%. The genome houses 44 gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, in which 20 gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides and nonribosomally synthesized peptides. High-throughput sequencing was further performed and genetic variants were identified from pooled libraries consisting of the 30 highest-yield mutants or 30 lowest-yield mutants. More than 350 genetic variants associated with {$\epsilon$}-PL yield have been identified. One hundred sixty-two affected proteins, from important metabolic enzymes to novel transcriptional regulators, were identified as being related to {$\epsilon$}-PL synthesis. HrdD, one of the affected genes, is a sigma factor that shows the most sensitive response to pH change and contains a non-synonymous mutation (A132V) in mutant strains with lower {$\epsilon$}-PL yields. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the pls gene is likely regulated by transcriptional activator HrdD. The data obtained in this study will facilitate future studies on {$\epsilon$}-PL yield improvement and industrial bioprocess optimization.},

However, the complexity of edaphic microenvironment hinders the advances toward understanding the environmental functionalities and ecological roles of soil biofilms. In this work, artificial soil was employed to investigate the soil biofilm formation and corresponding impacts on community structure and microbial activities. Our results showed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was significantly enhanced and micro-meter sized cell aggregates formed with high glucose amendment. Biofilm development exhibited significant effects on the soil microbial processes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the soils with biofilms and free-living cells shared similar microbial communities. But the Shannon diversity and evenness indices of communities with soil biofilms were significantly enhanced by 18.2\% and 17.1\%. The soil with biofilms also revealed a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which consumed 65.4\% more oxygen in the topsoil (0\textendash 1.5\,mm). Kinetic respiration analysis showed that the enhanced metabolic activity was attributed to 23-times more active microbes in soil biofilms. In summary, this study revealed that soil biofilms can sustain a diverse and robust community to drive soil biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {It is urgent to understand the regulatory mechanism of drug resistance in widespread bacterial pathogens. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, several transcriptional regulators have been found to play essential roles in regulating its drug resistance. In this study, we found that an ArsR family transcription regulator encoded by Rv2642 (CdiR) responds to isoniazid (INH), a widely used anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug. CdiR negatively regulates self and adjacent genes, including arsC (arsenic-transport integral membrane protein ArsC). CdiR directly interacts with INH and Cd(II). The binding of INH and Cd(II) both reduce its DNA-binding activity. Disrupting cdiR increased the drug susceptibility to INH, whereas overexpressing cdiR decreased the susceptibility. Strikingly, overexpressing arsC increased the drug susceptibility as well as cdiR. Additionally, both changes in cdiR and arsC expression caused sensitivity to other drugs such as rifamycin and ethambutol, where the minimal inhibitory concentrations in the cdiR deletion strain were equal to those of the arsC-overexpressing strain, suggesting that the function of CdiR in regulating drug resistance primarily depends on arsC. Furthermore, we found that Cd(II) enhances bacterial resistance to INH in a CdiR-dependent manner. As a conclusion, CdiR has a critical role in directing the interplay between Cd(II) metal ions and drug susceptibility in mycobacteria.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms of these systems, particularly their interaction with other cellular components, are still poorly understood. This study investigated cross-talk between the TA module RelJ/K (Rv3357/Rv3358) and the transcriptional regulator staphylococcal iron regulator repressor (SirR, Rv2788) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We characterized the physical interaction of SirR with both RelJ and RelK using bacterial two-hybrid, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Similarly to RelK, SirR regulates the DNA-binding activity of RelJ and alleviates its inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv3357p promoter. Furthermore, SirR may replace RelJ to alleviate the inhibitory effect of the toxin RelK on bacterial growth. Conversely, both RelJ and RelK competitively inhibit the interaction between SirR and their respective promoters. Thus, our results show that SirR interacts with a pair of toxin and antitoxin proteins, and exhibits antitoxin-like function to neutralize the toxin. These findings demonstrate a novel function of the SirR regulator of M. tuberculosis as well as a novel mechanism of regulation of TA systems.},

However, the pathway through which Mycobacterium tuberculosis responds INH remain largely unclear. In this study, we characterized a novel transcriptional factor, InbR, which is encoded by Rv0275c and belongs to the TetR family, that is directly responsive to INH. Disrupting inbR made mycobacteria more sensitive to INH, whereas overexpressing inbR decreased bacterial susceptibility to the drug. InbR could bind specifically to the upstream region of its own operon at two inverted repeats and act as an auto-repressor. Furthermore, InbR directly bind with INH, and the binding reduced InbR's DNA-binding ability. Interestingly, susceptibilities were also changed by InbR for other anti-TB drugs, such as rifampin, implying that InbR may play a role in multi-drug resistance. Additionally, microarray analyses revealed a portion genes of the inbR regulon have similar expression patterns in inbR-overexpressing strain and INH-treated wild type strain, suggesting that these genes, for example iniBAC, may be responsible to the drug resistance of inbR-overexpressing strain. The regulation of these genes by InbR were further assessed by ChIP-seq assay. InbR may regulate multiple drug resistance of mycobacteria through the regulation of these genes.},

However, only a few transcription factors that regulate drug resistance have been characterized in mycobacteria. In this study, a TetR family transcriptional factor (OxiR), encoded by Rv0067c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was found to be an isoniazid (INH) resistance regulator. Comparing with the wild-type strain, the oxiR overexpressing strain is four times resistant to INH, whereas the oxiR knockout strain is eight times sensitive to INH. However, the rifamycin and ethambutol resistance were not influenced by oxiR. OxiR can bind to self-promoter at a 66 bp imperfect palindromic motifs. Interestingly, OxiR directly binds to INH, and thereby alleviate the self-repression. Furthermore, OxiR negatively regulated an oxidoreductase encoded by Rv0068. And the susceptibility of the Rv0068-overexpressing and oxiR knockout strains to all the three above-mentioned anti-tuberculosis drugs was equivalent, suggesting that the effect of oxiR to INH susceptibility is attributed to the derepression of Rv0068. In conclusion, we showed that OxiR can specifically modulate INH susceptibility by regulating an oxidoreductase encoding gene, both of which have not been associated with drug-resistance previously.},
