# Multiple SSL Backends
#
# In order to make SSL (https) connections, libcurl uses an SSL backend. 
# Currently the Windows version of the curl package supports two SSL backends: 
# OpenSSL and Windows Secure Channel. Only one can be enabled, 
# which is determined when the curl package is first loaded in your R session.
#
# The default backend on Windows 7 and up is Secure Channel. 
# This uses the native Windows SSL API and certificates, which is the safest choice for most users.
#
# To switch to OpenSSL, you need to set an environment variable  CURL_SSL_BACKEND to "openssl" 
# when starting R. A good place to set this is in your .Renviron file in your user home (Documents) directory; 
# the ?Startup manual has more details.
CURL_SSL_BACKEND=openssl
