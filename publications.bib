  abstract = {Soil, composed mainly of minerals, plays a central role in the circulation of microbial pathogens in the environment. Herein, the growth, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 were monitored following exposure to montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite, three common soil minerals in the clay size fraction. E.~coli O157:H7 growth was notably promoted (P {$<$} 0.05), while biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of montmorillonite (P {$<$} 0.05), which is attributed to the suppression of colanic acid (CA) production and an increase in bacterial motility. Kaolinite not only promoted bacterial growth (P {$<$} 0.05), but also contributed to biofilm formation upon stimulating CA production. Upon exposure to goethite, notably slower bacterial growth and higher biomass of biofilm were observed as compared to the control (P {$<$} 0.05). Goethite stimulated the synthesis of CA to encase cells in a protective biofilm in response to the tight association between bacteria and goethite, which could cause bacterial death. Additionally, the transcription of virulence factors (stxA-1 and stxA-2) was significantly decreased in goethite or kaolinite system (P {$<$} 0.05). These findings indicate that minerals play important roles in the physiological state of bacteria and ultimately govern the fate of this pathogen in soils.},

Biofilms enable intensive inter- and intra-species interactions that can increase the degradation efficiency of soil organic matter and materials commonly regarded as toxins. Here, we first discuss organization, dynamics and properties of soil biofilms in the context of traditional approaches to probe the soil microbiome. Social interactions among bacteria, such as cooperation and competition, are discussed. We also summarize different biofilm cultivation devices in combination with optics and fluorescence microscopes as well as sequencing techniques for the study of soil biofilms. Microfluidic platforms, which can be applied to mimic the complex soil environment and study microbial behaviors at the microscale with high-throughput screening and novel measurements, are also highlighted. This review aims to highlight soil biofilm research in order to expand the current limited knowledge about soil microbiomes which until now has mostly ignored biofilms as a dominant growth form.},

To date, only a few Staphylococcus aureus strains containing CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, but no functional study in these strains has been reported. In this study, 6 clinical isolates of S. aureus with type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, and whole-genome sequencing and functional study were conducted subsequently. Genome sequence analysis revealed a close linkage between the CRISPR-Cas system and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element in five strains. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the type III-A repeats are conserved within staphylococci, despite of the decreased conservation in trailer-end repeats. Highly homologous sequences of some spacers were identified in staphylococcal MGEs, and partially complementary sequences of spacers were mostly found in the coding strand of lytic regions in staphylococcal phages. Transformation experiments showed that S. aureus type III-A CRISPR-Cas system can specifically prevent plasmid transfer in a transcription-dependent manner. Base paring between crRNA and target sequence, the endoribonuclease, and the Csm complex were proved to be necessary for type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity.},

A two-component system, PhoPR, is clearly involved in the regulation of pathogenic virulence and persistence. However, the regulatory mechanism, as well as the regulator, of the phoPR operon remains uncharacterized in M. tuberculosis and its related species thus far. In the present study, we characterize an ArsR transcriptional factor, corresponding to Rv2034 and Ms6762 in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, as the first regulator of phoP in both mycobacterial species. The interaction between ArsR regulator and target promoters is conserved in these two mycobacterial species, and an inverted repeat sequence motif is successfully mapped out for the recognition of ArsR. Utilizing lacZ reporter genes and overexpression analysis, the ArsR regulator is shown to positively regulate the expression of phoP in M. smegmatis, different from most ArsR family regulators generally as a repressor. The current study establishes a direct link between the ArsR transcriptional factor and the regulation of phoP in mycobacteria. Our findings imply that ArsR may be involved in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through its regulation of the phoPR operon.},

We also provide evidence that Rv2034 forms dimers in vitro. Furthermore, by using DNaseI footprinting assays, a palindromic sequence was identified as its binding site. Notably, we found that the dosR promoter region contains the binding motif for Rv2034, and that Rv2034 positively regulates the expression of the dosR gene.

However, the biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics. As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to the discovery of new antibiotics.},

In this study, interactions between two representative resident species (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida) and a leading food-borne disease causative pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were examined. An antagonistic effect toward V. parahaemolyticus was observed for B. subtilis but not for P. putida. However, the relative richness of the pathogen remained rather high in B. subtilis co-cultures and was, unexpectedly, not sensitive to the initial inoculation ratios. Furthermore, two approaches were found to be efficient at modulating the relative richness of the pathogen. (1) The addition of trace glycerol and manganese to Luria-Bertani medium (LBGM) reduced the richness of V. parahaemolyticus in the co-culture with B. subtilis and in contrast, increased its richness in the co-culture with P. putida, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus by its own. (2) The relative richness of V. parahaemolyticus on semisolid medium decreased significantly as a function of an agar gradient, ranging from 0 to 2\%. Furthermore, we explored the molecular basis of bacterial interaction through transcriptomic analysis. In summary, we investigated the interactions between a pathogen invader and two resident bacteria species, showing that the different influences on a pathogen by different types of interactions can be modulated by chemicals and medium fluidity.},

In this study, we examined the effects of various metal oxide NPs on inhibiting PCR, using high- vs. low-fidelity DNA polymerases; we also examined NP-induced DNA mutation bias at the single nucleotide level. The effects of seven major types of metal oxide NPs (Fe2O3, ZnO, CeO2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) on PCR replication via a low-fidelity DNA polymerase (Ex Taq) and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) were tested. The successfully amplified PCR products were subsequently sequenced using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Using consistent proportions of NPs and DNA, we found that the effects of NPs on PCR yield differed depending on the DNA polymerase. Specifically, the efficiency of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) was significantly inhibited by NPs during PCR; such inhibition was not evident in reactions with Ex Taq. Amplicon sequencing showed that the overall error rate of NP-amended PCR was not significantly different from that of PCR without NPs (p {$>$} 0.05), and NPs did not introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms during PCR. Thus, overall, NPs inhibited PCR amplification in a DNA polymerase-specific manner, but mutations were not introduced in the process.},

However, in lower prokaryotes and eukaryotic metazoans, it is usually difficult to find transcription regulatory factors that recognize specific target promoters. To address this, we have developed in this study a new bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector system that provides a convenient and rapid strategy to determine the specific interaction between target DNA sequences and their transcription factors. Using this system, we have successfully determined the DNA-binding specificity of the transcription regulator Rv3133c to a previously reported promoter region of the gene Rv2031 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we have tested more than 20 promoter regions of M. tuberculosis genes using this approach to determine if they interact with approximately 150 putative regulatory proteins. A variety of transcription factors are found to participate in the regulation of stress response and fatty acid metabolism, both of which comprise the core of in vivo-induced genes when M. tuberculosis invades macrophages. Interestingly, among the many new discovered potential transcription factors, the WhiB-like transcriptional factor WhiB3 was identified for the first time to bind with the promoter sequences of most in vivo-induced genes. Therefore, this study offers important data in the dissection of the transcription regulations in M. tuberculosis, and the strategy should be applicable in the study of DNA-binding factors in a wide range of biological organisms.},

However, these interactions and their impacts on the behavior and fate of minerals remain poorly understood. Here, for a better understanding of the colloidal stability of minerals in the environment, we investigated the aggregation of goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of EPS from Bacillus subtilis under different environmental conditions (pH, ionic strength and ionic valence). Results showed that the aggregation processes of goethite NPs are determined by the solution chemistry, and the colloidal stability of goethite NPs is strongly influenced by the addition of EPS. In the absence of ionic strength, the addition of EPS promotes the aggregation of goethite NPs only when the pH (pH = 6) is less than the point of zero charge for the goethite nanoparticles (pHpzc {$\approx$} 8). In the presence of ionic strength, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases with increasing concentration of NaCl, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 solutions, and after the addition of EPS solution, the critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of goethite NPs are increased from 43.0, 56.7 and 0.39 mM to 168.0, 304.9 and 126.2 mM in the three electrolyte solutions, indicating that the addition of EPS inhibits the aggregation of goethite NPs. While in Na3PO4 solution, when the concentration of Na3PO4 solution ranged from 0 to 1 mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases first, followed by a decrease, and with the concentration of Na3PO4 solution exceeding 1 mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases again, due to the charge screening by sodium counter ions. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the behavior of goethite NPs in natural soil and water environments.},

The abundance of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 in Brown soil (Alfisol) particles increased 0.6\textendash 1.4 log10 CFU/g within 3 days (except for NOM-stripped clay), while that in Red soil (Ultisol) particles decreased rapidly in 8 days post-inoculation. Additionally, survival of bacteria was significantly enhanced when Fe/Al (hydro)oxides had been removed from Red soil particles. For the two soils, E. coli O157:H7 survived the longest in NOM-present clays and the bacterial adenosine 5{${'}$}-triphosphate (ATP) levels were 0.7\textendash 2.0 times greater in clays than in sands and silts on day 8. Moreover, clays were more effective than silts and sands in binding cells and changing the expressions of acetate pathway-associated genes (pta and ackA). For silts and sands, E. coli O157:H7 decayed more rapidly in the presence of NOM and similar trends of bacterial ATP levels were observed between NOM-stripped and NOM-present soil particles, indicating that the primary role of NOM was not as a nutrient supply. These findings indicate that soil particles function mainly through attachment to change the metabolic pathway of E. coli O157:H7 and ultimately impact the survival of bacterial pathogens in soils.},

  abstract = {Clay minerals and metal oxides, as important parts of the soil matrix, play crucial roles in the development of microbial communities. However, the mechanism underlying such a process, particularly on the formation of soil biofilm, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite on the biofilm formation of the representative soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial biofilm formation in goethite was found to be impaired in the initial 24\,h but burst at 48\,h in the liquid\textendash air interface. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm biomass in goethite was 3\textendash 16 times that of the control, montmorillonite, and kaolinite at 48\,h. Live/Dead staining showed that cells had the highest death rate of 60\% after 4\,h of contact with goethite, followed by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Atomic force microscopy showed that the interaction between goethite and bacteria may injure bacterial cells by puncturing cell wall, leading to the swarming of bacteria toward the liquid\textendash air interface. Additionally, the expressions of abrB and sinR, key players in regulating the biofilm formation, were upregulated at 24\,h and downregulated at 48\,h in goethite, indicating the initial adaptation of the cells to minerals. A model was proposed to describe the effects of goethite on the biofilm formation. Our findings may facilitate a better understanding of the roles of soil clays in biofilm development and the manipulation of bacterial compositions through controlling the biofilm in soils. The effect of three soil minerals on biofilm production is clarified by research using the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The mineral composition of soil is known to affect biofilm production, but the mechanisms underpinning minerals' influences have not been well studied. Peng Cai and colleagues at Huazhong Agricultural University in China, with co-workers in the United States and Singapore, studied Bacillus subtilis growing in the presence of the minerals montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite. Their results suggest the minerals, especially goethite, can encourage biofilm formation by promoting the bursting of bacterial cells. The effect of goethite was attributed to the size of its grains being generally smaller than the bacterial cells. By quantifying the effect of these minerals, the research will assist understanding of biofilm formation and the growth and persistence of bacterial populations in soils.},

However, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the ATP content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn2+ originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn2+ on HA. The combined results from this work suggest that the biofilm maturity stages and environmental constituents (such as humic acid) are important factors to consider when evaluating potential risks of NPs to ecological systems.},

The performance of photocatalytic disinfection was investigated by the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Both C60/C3N4 and C70/C3N4 hybrids showed similar crystalline structure and morphology with C3N4; however, the two composites exhibited stronger bacterial inactivation than C3N4. In particular, C70/C3N4 showed the highest bactericidal efficiency and was detrimental to all E. coli O157:H7 in 4 h irradiation. Compared to C3N4, the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of composites could be attributed to the effective transfer of the photoinduced electrons under visible light irradiation. Owing to the excellent performance of fullerenes (C60, C70)/C3N4 composites, a visible light response and environmental friendly photocatalysts for disinfection were achieved.},

Humic-acid equivalent (HAE) was used as an indicator for extracellular contamination and ATP for quantifying intracellular contamination from cell lysis. Among the tested methods, CER resulted in EPS extraction with minimal contamination. Therefore, we propose that CER is currently the most appropriate method for extraction of EPS from Ultisols.},

This study looks at the construction of a global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, based on a high-throughput bacterial two-hybrid method. Almost the entire ORFeome was cloned, and more than 8000 novel interactions were identified. The overall quality of the PPI network was validated through two independent methods, and a high success rate of more than 60\% was obtained. The parameters of PPI networks were calculated. The average shortest path length was 4.31. The topological coefficient of the M. tuberculosis B2H network perfectly followed a power law distribution (correlation = 0.999; R-squared = 0.999) and represented the best fit in all currently available PPI networks. A cross-species PPI network comparison revealed 94 conserved subnetworks between M. tuberculosis and several prokaryotic organism PPI networks. The global network was linked to the protein secretion pathway. Two WhiB-like regulators were found to be highly connected proteins in the global network. This is the first systematic noncomputational PPI data for the human pathogen, and it provides a useful resource for studies of infection mechanisms, new signaling pathways, and novel antituberculosis drug development.},

Our results showed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was significantly enhanced and micro-meter sized cell aggregates formed with high glucose amendment. Biofilm development exhibited significant effects on the soil microbial processes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the soils with biofilms and free-living cells shared similar microbial communities. But the Shannon diversity and evenness indices of communities with soil biofilms were significantly enhanced by 18.2\% and 17.1\%. The soil with biofilms also revealed a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which consumed 65.4\% more oxygen in the topsoil (0\textendash 1.5 mm). Kinetic respiration analysis showed that the enhanced metabolic activity was attributed to 23-times more active microbes in soil biofilms. In summary, this study revealed that soil biofilms can sustain a diverse and robust community to drive soil biogeochemical processes.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms of these systems, particularly their interaction with other cellular components, are still poorly understood. This study investigated cross-talk between the TA module RelJ/K (Rv3357/Rv3358) and the transcriptional regulator staphylococcal iron regulator repressor (SirR, Rv2788) from Mycobacterium~tuberculosis. We characterized the physical interaction of SirR with both RelJ and RelK using bacterial two-hybrid, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Similarly to RelK, SirR regulates the DNA-binding activity of RelJ and alleviates its inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv3357p promoter. Furthermore, SirR may replace RelJ to alleviate the inhibitory effect of the toxin RelK on bacterial growth. Conversely, both RelJ and RelK competitively inhibit the interaction between SirR and their respective promoters. Thus, our results show that SirR interacts with a pair of toxin and antitoxin proteins, and exhibits antitoxin-like function to neutralize the toxin. These findings demonstrate a novel function of the SirR regulator of M.~tuberculosis as well as a novel mechanism of regulation of TA systems.

A conserved 19 bp-palindromic motif was identified for Ms6564 binding using DNaseI footprinting and EMSA. A total of 339 potential target genes for Ms6564 were further characterized by searching the M. smegmatis genome based on the sequence motif. Notably, Ms6564 bound with the promoters of 37 cell cycle and DNA damage/repair genes and regulated positively their expressions. The Ms6564-overexpressed recombinant strain yielded 5-fold lower mutation rates and mutation frequencies, whereas deletion of Ms6564 resulted in {$\sim$}5-fold higher mutation rates for the mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain. These findings suggested that Ms6564 may function as a global regulator and might be a sensor necessary for activation of DNA damage/repair genes.},

However, the regulatory model of the marRAB operon in mycobacteria remains to be characterized. Here we report that a MarR, encoded by Ms6508, and its marRAB operon specifically contribute to rifampicin (RIF) resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We show that the MarR recognizes a conserved 21-bp palindromic motif and negatively regulates the expression of two ABC transporters in the operon, encoded by Ms6509\textendash 6510. Unlike other known drug efflux pumps, overexpression of these two ABC transporters unexpectedly increased RIF sensitivity and deletion of these two genes increased mycobacterial resistance to the antibiotic. No change can be detected for the sensitivity of recombinant mycobacterial strains to three other anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, HPLC experiments suggested that Ms6509\textendash Ms6510 could pump RIF into the mycobacterial cells. These findings indicated that the mycobacterial MarR functions as a repressor and constitutively inhibits the expression of the marRAB operon, which specifically contributes to RIF resistance in M. smegmatis. Therefore, our data suggest a new regulatory mechanism of RIF resistance and also provide the new insight into the regulatory model of a marRAB operon in mycobacteria.},
