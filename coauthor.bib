  abstract = {Soil, composed mainly of minerals, plays a central role in the circulation of microbial pathogens in the environment. Herein, the growth, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 were monitored following exposure to montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite, three common soil minerals in the clay size fraction. E.~coli O157:H7 growth was notably promoted (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), while biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of montmorillonite (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), which is attributed to the suppression of colanic acid (CA) production and an increase in bacterial motility. Kaolinite not only promoted bacterial growth (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), but also contributed to biofilm formation upon stimulating CA production. Upon exposure to goethite, notably slower bacterial growth and higher biomass of biofilm were observed as compared to the control (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Goethite stimulated the synthesis of CA to encase cells in a protective biofilm in response to the tight association between bacteria and goethite, which could cause bacterial death. Additionally, the transcription of virulence factors (stxA-1 and stxA-2) was significantly decreased in goethite or kaolinite system (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). These findings indicate that minerals play important roles in the physiological state of bacteria and ultimately govern the fate of this pathogen in soils.},

Biofilms enable intensive inter- and intra-species interactions that can increase the degradation efficiency of soil organic matter and materials commonly regarded as toxins. Here, we first discuss organization, dynamics and properties of soil biofilms in the context of traditional approaches to probe the soil microbiome. Social interactions among bacteria, such as cooperation and competition, are discussed. We also summarize different biofilm cultivation devices in combination with optics and fluorescence microscopes as well as sequencing techniques for the study of soil biofilms. Microfluidic platforms, which can be applied to mimic the complex soil environment and study microbial behaviors at the microscale with high-throughput screening and novel measurements, are also highlighted. This review aims to highlight soil biofilm research in order to expand the current limited knowledge about soil microbiomes which until now has mostly ignored biofilms as a dominant growth form.},

  abstract = {Bacterial natural products (NPs) are considered to be a promising source of drug discovery. However, the biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics. As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to the discovery of new antibiotics.},

  abstract = {Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are ubiquitous in the soil and water environment and interact strongly with mineral surfaces. However, these interactions and their impacts on the behavior and fate of minerals remain poorly understood. Here, for a better understanding of the colloidal stability of minerals in the environment, we investigated the aggregation of goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of EPS from Bacillus subtilis under different environmental conditions (pH, ionic strength and ionic valence). Results showed that the aggregation processes of goethite NPs are determined by the solution chemistry, and the colloidal stability of goethite NPs is strongly influenced by the addition of EPS. In the absence of ionic strength, the addition of EPS promotes the aggregation of goethite NPs only when the pH (pH\,=\,6) is less than the point of zero charge for the goethite nanoparticles (pHpzc\,{$\approx$}\,8). In the presence of ionic strength, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases with increasing concentration of NaCl, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 solutions, and after the addition of EPS solution, the critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of goethite NPs are increased from 43.0, 56.7 and 0.39\,mM to 168.0, 304.9 and 126.2\,mM in the three electrolyte solutions, indicating that the addition of EPS inhibits the aggregation of goethite NPs. While in Na3PO4 solution, when the concentration of Na3PO4 solution ranged from 0 to 1\,mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases first, followed by a decrease, and with the concentration of Na3PO4 solution exceeding 1\,mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases again, due to the charge screening by sodium counter ions. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the behavior of goethite NPs in natural soil and water environments.},

Here, the effects of soil type, particle size, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) or Fe/Al (hydro)oxides on pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 survival in sterilized soil particles were assessed through survival, attachment, metabolic activity, and qRT-PCR analyses. The abundance of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 in Brown soil (Alfisol) particles increased 0.6\textendash 1.4 log10 CFU/g within 3 days (except for NOM-stripped clay), while that in Red soil (Ultisol) particles decreased rapidly in 8 days post-inoculation. Additionally, survival of bacteria was significantly enhanced when Fe/Al (hydro)oxides had been removed from Red soil particles. For the two soils, E. coli O157:H7 survived the longest in NOM-present clays and the bacterial adenosine 5{${'}$}-triphosphate (ATP) levels were 0.7\textendash 2.0 times greater in clays than in sands and silts on day 8. Moreover, clays were more effective than silts and sands in binding cells and changing the expressions of acetate pathway-associated genes (pta and ackA). For silts and sands, E. coli O157:H7 decayed more rapidly in the presence of NOM and similar trends of bacterial ATP levels were observed between NOM-stripped and NOM-present soil particles, indicating that the primary role of NOM was not as a nutrient supply. These findings indicate that soil particles function mainly through attachment to change the metabolic pathway of E. coli O157:H7 and ultimately impact the survival of bacterial pathogens in soils.},

  abstract = {Clay minerals and metal oxides, as important parts of the soil matrix, play crucial roles in the development of microbial communities. However, the mechanism underlying such a process, particularly on the formation of soil biofilm, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite on the biofilm formation of the representative soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial biofilm formation in goethite was found to be impaired in the initial 24\,h but burst at 48\,h in the liquid\textendash air interface. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm biomass in goethite was 3\textendash 16 times that of the control, montmorillonite, and kaolinite at 48\,h. Live/Dead staining showed that cells had the highest death rate of 60\% after 4\,h of contact with goethite, followed by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Atomic force microscopy showed that the interaction between goethite and bacteria may injure bacterial cells by puncturing cell wall, leading to the swarming of bacteria toward the liquid\textendash air interface. Additionally, the expressions of abrB and sinR, key players in regulating the biofilm formation, were upregulated at 24\,h and downregulated at 48\,h in goethite, indicating the initial adaptation of the cells to minerals. A model was proposed to describe the effects of goethite on the biofilm formation. Our findings may facilitate a better understanding of the roles of soil clays in biofilm development and the manipulation of bacterial compositions through controlling the biofilm in soils. The effect of three soil minerals on biofilm production is clarified by research using the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The mineral composition of soil is known to affect biofilm production, but the mechanisms underpinning minerals' influences have not been well studied. Peng Cai and colleagues at Huazhong Agricultural University in China, with co-workers in the United States and Singapore, studied Bacillus subtilis growing in the presence of the minerals montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite. Their results suggest the minerals, especially goethite, can encourage biofilm formation by promoting the bursting of bacterial cells. The effect of goethite was attributed to the size of its grains being generally smaller than the bacterial cells. By quantifying the effect of these minerals, the research will assist understanding of biofilm formation and the growth and persistence of bacterial populations in soils.},

  abstract = {The effects of humic acid (HA) on interactions between ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 biofilms at different maturity stages were investigated. Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the ATP content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90\% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. However, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the ATP content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn2+ originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn2+ on HA. The combined results from this work suggest that the biofilm maturity stages and environmental constituents (such as humic acid) are important factors to consider when evaluating potential risks of NPs to ecological systems.},

However, such a topic has not been well investigated; hence, this study was designed to explore the interactions of NOM, NPs, and bacteria in a model system and, specifically, the influence of surface-bound humic acid (HA) on the toxicity of hematite NPs to Pseudomonas putida. Results showed that pure hematite NPs could inhibit the bacterial growth with a median lethal concentration (24 h LC50) of 23.58 mg L-1, while surface-bound HA could significantly mitigate the toxicity of hematite with the highest LC50 of 4774.23 mg L-1, which were corroborated by the transcriptional regulation of Pseudomonas putida cell activity-related genes. Co-precipitation experiments and transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that surfacebound HA prevented the adhesion of hematite to the cells and limited cell internalization. Compared to hematite NPs, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of oxidative stress genes were significantly inhibited in hematite surface-bound HA systems. The prevention of adhesion and inhibition of ROS production could account for the HA-mitigated nanotoxicity. Interfacial interactions between hematite and bacteria were also evaluated on the basis of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, suggesting that the more adhesive conditions resulted in greater toxicity and the more repulsive conditions resulted in a reduced toxicity of the model microorganism. The results of this study serve as a platform to better understand the interactions between bacteria or bacterial biofilms and minerals in the natural environment.},

Interactions among matrix components within biofilms are responsible for creating an adaptable structure during biofilm development. However, it is unclear how the interactions among matrix components contribute to the construction of the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architecture. Results DNase I treatment significantly inhibited Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation in the early phases of biofilm development. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis revealed that eDNA was cooperative with exopolysaccharide (EPS) in the early stages of B. subtilis biofilm development, while EPS played a major structural role in the later stages. In addition, deletion of the EPS production gene epsG in B. subtilis SBE1 resulted in loss of the interaction between EPS and eDNA and reduced the biofilm biomass in pellicles at the air-liquid interface. The physical interaction between these two essential biofilm matrix components was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Conclusions Biofilm 3D structures become interconnected through surrounding eDNA and EPS. eDNA interacts with EPS in the early phases of biofilm development, while EPS mainly participates in the maturation of biofilms. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the role of the interaction between eDNA and EPS in shaping the biofilm 3D matrix structure and biofilm formation.},

  abstract = {Soil contamination poses a serious threat to ecosystem and human well-being. Compared to conventional physical and chemical treatment, the microbial electrochemical system (MES) offers a sustainable and environment-friendly solution for soil bioremediation. In principle, soil microbe degrades organic substrate and releases electron in anode region. The electron flows through electric circuit to the cathode and finally is accepted by oxygen or oxidized metals. With various inherent advantages, MES has been applied in petroleum hydrocarbon, chlorinated organics and heavy metals bioremediation in soils. This paper aims to review the recent advances of MES in soil bioremediation, including main mechanisms of contaminant removal with MES, configurations of soil MES and current development in bioremediation of soil contaminated by organic and inorganic pollutants. Moreover, challenges and future prospects of soil MES are discussed.},

  abstract = {Biofilms have been extensively studied in aquatic and clinical environments. However, the complexity of edaphic microenvironment hinders the advances toward understanding the environmental functionalities and ecological roles of soil biofilms. In this work, artificial soil was employed to investigate the soil biofilm formation and corresponding impacts on community structure and microbial activities. Our results showed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was significantly enhanced and micro-meter sized cell aggregates formed with high glucose amendment. Biofilm development exhibited significant effects on the soil microbial processes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the soils with biofilms and free-living cells shared similar microbial communities. But the Shannon diversity and evenness indices of communities with soil biofilms were significantly enhanced by 18.2\% and 17.1\%. The soil with biofilms also revealed a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which consumed 65.4\% more oxygen in the topsoil (0\textendash 1.5\,mm). Kinetic respiration analysis showed that the enhanced metabolic activity was attributed to 23-times more active microbes in soil biofilms. In summary, this study revealed that soil biofilms can sustain a diverse and robust community to drive soil biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {The bacteria drug resistance is not only associated with the gain of drug resistance gene but also relied on the adaptation of bacterial cells to antibiotics by transcriptional regulation. However, only a few transcription factors that regulate drug resistance have been characterized in mycobacteria. In this study, a TetR family transcriptional factor (OxiR), encoded by Rv0067c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was found to be an isoniazid (INH) resistance regulator. Comparing with the wild-type strain, the oxiR overexpressing strain is four times resistant to INH, whereas the oxiR knockout strain is eight times sensitive to INH. However, the rifamycin and ethambutol resistance were not influenced by oxiR. OxiR can bind to self-promoter at a 66 bp imperfect palindromic motifs. Interestingly, OxiR directly binds to INH, and thereby alleviate the self-repression. Furthermore, OxiR negatively regulated an oxidoreductase encoded by Rv0068. And the susceptibility of the Rv0068-overexpressing and oxiR knockout strains to all the three above-mentioned anti-tuberculosis drugs was equivalent, suggesting that the effect of oxiR to INH susceptibility is attributed to the derepression of Rv0068. In conclusion, we showed that OxiR can specifically modulate INH susceptibility by regulating an oxidoreductase encoding gene, both of which have not been associated with drug-resistance previously.},
