  abstract = {Soil, composed mainly of minerals, plays a central role in the circulation of microbial pathogens in the environment. Herein, the growth, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression of the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli O157:H7 were monitored following exposure to montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite, three common soil minerals in the clay size fraction. E.~coli O157:H7 growth was notably promoted (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), while biofilm formation was inhibited in the presence of montmorillonite (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), which is attributed to the suppression of colanic acid (CA) production and an increase in bacterial motility. Kaolinite not only promoted bacterial growth (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), but also contributed to biofilm formation upon stimulating CA production. Upon exposure to goethite, notably slower bacterial growth and higher biomass of biofilm were observed as compared to the control (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Goethite stimulated the synthesis of CA to encase cells in a protective biofilm in response to the tight association between bacteria and goethite, which could cause bacterial death. Additionally, the transcription of virulence factors (stxA-1 and stxA-2) was significantly decreased in goethite or kaolinite system (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). These findings indicate that minerals play important roles in the physiological state of bacteria and ultimately govern the fate of this pathogen in soils.},

  abstract = {Soil is inhabited by a myriad of microorganisms, many of which can form supracellular structures, called biofilms, comprised of surface-associated microbial cells embedded in hydrated extracellular polymeric substance that facilitates adhesion and survival. Biofilms enable intensive inter- and intra-species interactions that can increase the degradation efficiency of soil organic matter and materials commonly regarded as toxins. Here, we first discuss organization, dynamics and properties of soil biofilms in the context of traditional approaches to probe the soil microbiome. Social interactions among bacteria, such as cooperation and competition, are discussed. We also summarize different biofilm cultivation devices in combination with optics and fluorescence microscopes as well as sequencing techniques for the study of soil biofilms. Microfluidic platforms, which can be applied to mimic the complex soil environment and study microbial behaviors at the microscale with high-throughput screening and novel measurements, are also highlighted. This review aims to highlight soil biofilm research in order to expand the current limited knowledge about soil microbiomes which until now has mostly ignored biofilms as a dominant growth form.},

To date, only a few Staphylococcus aureus strains containing CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified, but no functional study in these strains has been reported. In this study, 6 clinical isolates of S. aureus with type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems were identified, and whole-genome sequencing and functional study were conducted subsequently. Genome sequence analysis revealed a close linkage between the CRISPR-Cas system and the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) element in five strains. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the type III-A repeats are conserved within staphylococci, despite of the decreased conservation in trailer-end repeats. Highly homologous sequences of some spacers were identified in staphylococcal MGEs, and partially complementary sequences of spacers were mostly found in the coding strand of lytic regions in staphylococcal phages. Transformation experiments showed that S. aureus type III-A CRISPR-Cas system can specifically prevent plasmid transfer in a transcription-dependent manner. Base paring between crRNA and target sequence, the endoribonuclease, and the Csm complex were proved to be necessary for type III-A CRISPR-Cas immunity.},

A two-component system, PhoPR, is clearly involved in the regulation of pathogenic virulence and persistence. However, the regulatory mechanism, as well as the regulator, of the phoPR operon remains uncharacterized in M. tuberculosis and its related species thus far. In the present study, we characterize an ArsR transcriptional factor, corresponding to Rv2034 and Ms6762 in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, respectively, as the first regulator of phoP in both mycobacterial species. The interaction between ArsR regulator and target promoters is conserved in these two mycobacterial species, and an inverted repeat sequence motif is successfully mapped out for the recognition of ArsR. Utilizing lacZ reporter genes and overexpression analysis, the ArsR regulator is shown to positively regulate the expression of phoP in M. smegmatis, different from most ArsR family regulators generally as a repressor. The current study establishes a direct link between the ArsR transcriptional factor and the regulation of phoP in mycobacteria. Our findings imply that ArsR may be involved in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through its regulation of the phoPR operon.},

We also provide evidence that Rv2034 forms dimers in vitro. Furthermore, by using DNaseI footprinting assays, a palindromic sequence was identified as its binding site. Notably, we found that the dosR promoter region contains the binding motif for Rv2034, and that Rv2034 positively regulates the expression of the dosR gene. The potential roles of Rv2034 in the regulation of lipid metabolism and hypoxic adaptation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Bacterial natural products (NPs) are considered to be a promising source of drug discovery. However, the biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs) of NP are not often expressed, making it difficult to identify them. Recently, the study of biofilm community showed bacteria may gain competitive advantages by the secretion of antibiotics, implying a possible way to screen antibiotic by evaluating the social behavior of bacteria. In this study, we have described an efficient workflow for novel antibiotic discovery by employing the bacterial social interaction strategy with biofilm cultivation, co-culture, transcriptomic and genomic methods. We showed that a biofilm dominant species, i.e. Pseudomonas sp. G7, which was isolated from cultivated soil biofilm community, was highly competitive in four-species biofilm communities, as the synergistic combinations preferred to exclude this strain while the antagonistic combinations did not. Through the analysis of transcriptomic changes in four-species co-culture and the complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. G7, we finally discovered two novel non-ribosomal polypeptide synthetic (NRPS) BGCs, whose products were predicted to have seven and six amino acid components, respectively. Furthermore, we provide evidence showing that only when Pseudomonas sp. G7 was co-cultivated with at least two or three other bacterial species can these BGC genes be induced, suggesting that the co-culture of the soil biofilm isolates is critical to the discovery of novel antibiotics. As a conclusion, we set a model of applying microbial interaction to the discovery of new antibiotics.},

In this study, interactions between two representative resident species (Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida) and a leading food-borne disease causative pathogen (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) were examined. An antagonistic effect toward V. parahaemolyticus was observed for B. subtilis but not for P. putida. However, the relative richness of the pathogen remained rather high in B. subtilis co-cultures and was, unexpectedly, not sensitive to the initial inoculation ratios. Furthermore, two approaches were found to be efficient at modulating the relative richness of the pathogen. (1) The addition of trace glycerol and manganese to Luria-Bertani medium (LBGM) reduced the richness of V. parahaemolyticus in the co-culture with B. subtilis and in contrast, increased its richness in the co-culture with P. putida, although it did not affect the growth of V. parahaemolyticus by its own. (2) The relative richness of V. parahaemolyticus on semisolid medium decreased significantly as a function of an agar gradient, ranging from 0 to 2\%. Furthermore, we explored the molecular basis of bacterial interaction through transcriptomic analysis. In summary, we investigated the interactions between a pathogen invader and two resident bacteria species, showing that the different influences on a pathogen by different types of interactions can be modulated by chemicals and medium fluidity.},

  abstract = {Taxonomic convergence is common in bacterial communities but its underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. We thus conducted a time-series transcriptional analysis of a convergent two-species synthetic community that grew in a closed broth-culture system. By analyzing the gene expression and monitoring the community structure, we found that gene expression mainly changed in the early stage, whereas community structure significantly changed in the late stage. The significant change of gene expression occurred even at the very beginning, which was designated as ``0\,h effect'', suggesting the effect of species interaction on gene expression was inevitable. Besides, the effect of interaction on gene expression has a ``population effect'', which means that majority species have greater impact on gene expressions of minority species than vice versa. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that among a total of 63 unique pathways (occupying about 50\% of all the metabolic pathways in both species), 40 (63\%) were consistently suppressed, 16 (25\%) were conditionally expressed, and only 7 (11\%) were consistently activated. Overall, they were strictly regulated by both time and initial structures. Therefore, we proposed that microorganism responses and the induced gene expression changes play important roles in the process of community succession.},

In this study, we developed ggVennDiagram, an R package that could automatically generate high-quality Venn diagrams with two to seven sets. The ggVennDiagram is built based on ggplot2, and it integrates the advantages of existing packages, such as venn, RVenn, VennDiagram, and sf. Satisfactory results can be obtained with minimal configurations. Furthermore, we designed comprehensive objects to store the entire data of the Venn diagram, which allowed free access to both intersection values and Venn plot sub-elements, such as set label/edge and region label/filling. Therefore, high customization of every Venn plot sub-element can be fulfilled without increasing the cost of learning when the user is familiar with ggplot2 methods. To date, ggVennDiagram has been cited in more than 10 publications, and its source code repository has been starred by more than 140 GitHub users, suggesting a great potential in applications.

Prior results showed that several types of NPs inhibited PCR efficiency and increased amplicon error frequency. In this study, we examined the effects of various metal oxide NPs on inhibiting PCR, using high- vs. low-fidelity DNA polymerases; we also examined NP-induced DNA mutation bias at the single nucleotide level. The effects of seven major types of metal oxide NPs (Fe2O3, ZnO, CeO2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, CuO, and TiO2) on PCR replication via a low-fidelity DNA polymerase (Ex Taq) and a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) were tested. The successfully amplified PCR products were subsequently sequenced using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Using consistent proportions of NPs and DNA, we found that the effects of NPs on PCR yield differed depending on the DNA polymerase. Specifically, the efficiency of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) was significantly inhibited by NPs during PCR; such inhibition was not evident in reactions with Ex Taq. Amplicon sequencing showed that the overall error rate of NP-amended PCR was not significantly different from that of PCR without NPs (p {$>$} 0.05), and NPs did not introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms during PCR. Thus, overall, NPs inhibited PCR amplification in a DNA polymerase-specific manner, but mutations were not introduced in the process.},

We found that the final ratio of the cocultures with different initial inoculum ratios differed in approximately five-sixths of the carbon sources, suggesting that the final ratio is highly dependent on the initial inoculum ratio, while the carbon source preferences of bacteria could not predict the final ratio of cocultures. Furthermore, we found that the initial ratio could regulate the metabolic capacity of the coculture, as only cocultures with initial ratios of 1:1 and 1000:1 gained high capacity on 14 specific carbon sources. The underlying reason may be that the pattern of species interaction is changed by the initial ratio. In conclusion, we showed that the initial ratio can induce emergent properties in coculture. These findings suggest that the initial ratio not only impacts the reproducibility of coculture experiments but also can influence our understanding of generic microbial ecology.},

  abstract = {Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors have widespread biological significance in the regulation of gene expression. However, in lower prokaryotes and eukaryotic metazoans, it is usually difficult to find transcription regulatory factors that recognize specific target promoters. To address this, we have developed in this study a new bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector system that provides a convenient and rapid strategy to determine the specific interaction between target DNA sequences and their transcription factors. Using this system, we have successfully determined the DNA-binding specificity of the transcription regulator Rv3133c to a previously reported promoter region of the gene Rv2031 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we have tested more than 20 promoter regions of M. tuberculosis genes using this approach to determine if they interact with approximately 150 putative regulatory proteins. A variety of transcription factors are found to participate in the regulation of stress response and fatty acid metabolism, both of which comprise the core of in vivo-induced genes when M. tuberculosis invades macrophages. Interestingly, among the many new discovered potential transcription factors, the WhiB-like transcriptional factor WhiB3 was identified for the first time to bind with the promoter sequences of most in vivo-induced genes. Therefore, this study offers important data in the dissection of the transcription regulations in M. tuberculosis, and the strategy should be applicable in the study of DNA-binding factors in a wide range of biological organisms.},

However, the linkages between microbial diversity, especially rare and abundant bacterial diversity, and carbon decomposition remain largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the establishment and maintenance of rare and abundant bacterial {$\alpha$}-diversities at the taxonomic and phylogenetic levels and their linkages with soil carbon decomposition separately in four Chinese woodlands. Compared to abundant bacteria, rare bacteria showed higher community diversity, tighter phylogenetic clustering, wider environmental breadth, stronger phylogenetic signals, and higher functional redundancy. The assembly of the abundant bacterial subcommunity was governed by stochastic (59.2\%) and deterministic (41.8\%) processes, whereas the assembly of the rare bacterial subcommunity was mainly dominated by deterministic process (85.8\%). Furthermore, total phosphorus, soil pH, and ammonium nitrogen balanced stochastic and deterministic processes in both rare and abundant bacterial subcommunities. Our results reveal that rare bacteria displayed stronger environmental adaptability and environmental constraint. Importantly, the {$\alpha$}-diversities of rare taxa, rather than abundant taxa, were significantly related to carbon decomposition. This study provides a holistic understanding of biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacteria and their {$\alpha$}-diversities in relation to carbon decomposition, thus helping us better predict and regulate carbon dynamics under the background of global climate change.},

Although the antibacterial mechanisms of GO have been thoroughly elucidated, the dynamics of bacterial attachment on GO surfaces under environmentally relevant conditions remain largely unknown. In this study, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) was used to examine the dynamic attachment processes of a model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 onto GO surface under different ionic strengths (1\textendash 600 mM NaCl). Our results show the highest bacterial attachment at moderate ionic strengths (200\textendash 400 mM).

The extended Derjaguin\textendash Landau\textendash Verwey\textendash Overbeek (XDLVO) theory and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis were employed to reveal the mechanisms of the bacteria\textendash GO interactions under different ionic strengths. The strong electrostatic and steric repulsion at low ionic strengths (1\textendash 100 mM) was found to hinder the bacteria\textendash GO interaction, while the limited polymer bridging caused by the collapse of biopolymer layers reduced cell attachment at a high ionic strength (600 mM). These findings advance our understanding of the ionic strength-dependent bacteria\textendash GO interaction and provide implications to further improve the antibiofouling performance of GO-modified surfaces.},

  abstract = {The outer membrane c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts) OmcA and MtrC in Shewanella are key terminal reductases that bind and transfer electrons directly to iron (hydr)oxides. Although the amounts of OmcA and MtrC at the cell surface and their molecular structures are largely comparable, MtrC is known to play a more important role in dissimilatory iron reduction. To explore the roles of these outer membrane c-Cyts in the interaction of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with iron oxides, the processes of attachment of S. oneidensis MR-1 wild type and c-type cytochrome-deficient mutants (the {$\Delta$}omcA, {$\Delta$}mtrC, and {$\Delta$}omcA {$\Delta$}mtrC mutants) to goethite are compared via quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Strains with OmcA exhibit a rapid initial attachment. The quantitative model for QCM-D responses reveals that MtrC enhances the contact area and contact elasticity of cells with goethite by more than one and two times, respectively. In situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared two-dimensional correlation spectroscopic (ATR-FTIR 2D-CoS) analysis shows that MtrC promotes the initial interfacial reaction via an inner-sphere coordination. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis demonstrates that OmcA enhances the attractive force between cells and goethite by about 60\%. As a result, OmcA contributes to a higher attractive force with goethite and induces a rapid short-term attachment, while MtrC is more important in the longer-term interaction through an enhanced contact area, which promotes interfacial reactions. These results reveal that c-Cyts OmcA and MtrC adopt different mechanisms for enhancing the attachment of S. oneidensis MR-1 cells to goethite. It improves our understanding of the function of outer membrane c-Cyts and the influence of cell surface macromolecules in cell-mineral interactions.IMPORTANCEShewanella species are one group of versatile and widespread dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria, which are capable of respiring insoluble iron minerals via six multiheme c-type cytochromes. Outer membrane c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts) OmcA and MtrC are the terminal reductases in this pathway and have comparable protein structures. In this study, we elucidate the different roles of OmcA and MtrC in the interaction of S. oneidensis MR-1 with goethite at the whole-cell level. OmcA confers enhanced affinity toward goethite and results in rapid attachment. Meanwhile, MtrC significantly increases the contact area of bacterial cells with goethite and promotes the interfacial reaction, which may explain its central role in extracellular electron transfer. This study provides novel insights into the role of bacterial surface macromolecules in the interfacial interaction of bacteria with minerals, which is critical to the development of a comprehensive understanding of cell-mineral interactions.},

  abstract = {Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are ubiquitous in the soil and water environment and interact strongly with mineral surfaces. However, these interactions and their impacts on the behavior and fate of minerals remain poorly understood. Here, for a better understanding of the colloidal stability of minerals in the environment, we investigated the aggregation of goethite ({$\alpha$}-FeOOH) nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of EPS from Bacillus subtilis under different environmental conditions (pH, ionic strength and ionic valence). Results showed that the aggregation processes of goethite NPs are determined by the solution chemistry, and the colloidal stability of goethite NPs is strongly influenced by the addition of EPS. In the absence of ionic strength, the addition of EPS promotes the aggregation of goethite NPs only when the pH (pH\,=\,6) is less than the point of zero charge for the goethite nanoparticles (pHpzc\,{$\approx$}\,8). In the presence of ionic strength, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases with increasing concentration of NaCl, NaNO3 and Na2SO4 solutions, and after the addition of EPS solution, the critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of goethite NPs are increased from 43.0, 56.7 and 0.39\,mM to 168.0, 304.9 and 126.2\,mM in the three electrolyte solutions, indicating that the addition of EPS inhibits the aggregation of goethite NPs. While in Na3PO4 solution, when the concentration of Na3PO4 solution ranged from 0 to 1\,mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases first, followed by a decrease, and with the concentration of Na3PO4 solution exceeding 1\,mM, the aggregation rate of goethite NPs increases again, due to the charge screening by sodium counter ions. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the behavior of goethite NPs in natural soil and water environments.},

Here, the effects of soil type, particle size, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) or Fe/Al (hydro)oxides on pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 survival in sterilized soil particles were assessed through survival, attachment, metabolic activity, and qRT-PCR analyses. The abundance of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 in Brown soil (Alfisol) particles increased 0.6\textendash 1.4 log10 CFU/g within 3 days (except for NOM-stripped clay), while that in Red soil (Ultisol) particles decreased rapidly in 8 days post-inoculation. Additionally, survival of bacteria was significantly enhanced when Fe/Al (hydro)oxides had been removed from Red soil particles. For the two soils, E. coli O157:H7 survived the longest in NOM-present clays and the bacterial adenosine 5{${'}$}-triphosphate (ATP) levels were 0.7\textendash 2.0 times greater in clays than in sands and silts on day 8. Moreover, clays were more effective than silts and sands in binding cells and changing the expressions of acetate pathway-associated genes (pta and ackA). For silts and sands, E. coli O157:H7 decayed more rapidly in the presence of NOM and similar trends of bacterial ATP levels were observed between NOM-stripped and NOM-present soil particles, indicating that the primary role of NOM was not as a nutrient supply. These findings indicate that soil particles function mainly through attachment to change the metabolic pathway of E. coli O157:H7 and ultimately impact the survival of bacterial pathogens in soils.},

  abstract = {Clay minerals and metal oxides, as important parts of the soil matrix, play crucial roles in the development of microbial communities. However, the mechanism underlying such a process, particularly on the formation of soil biofilm, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite on the biofilm formation of the representative soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial biofilm formation in goethite was found to be impaired in the initial 24\,h but burst at 48\,h in the liquid\textendash air interface. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the biofilm biomass in goethite was 3\textendash 16 times that of the control, montmorillonite, and kaolinite at 48\,h. Live/Dead staining showed that cells had the highest death rate of 60\% after 4\,h of contact with goethite, followed by kaolinite and montmorillonite. Atomic force microscopy showed that the interaction between goethite and bacteria may injure bacterial cells by puncturing cell wall, leading to the swarming of bacteria toward the liquid\textendash air interface. Additionally, the expressions of abrB and sinR, key players in regulating the biofilm formation, were upregulated at 24\,h and downregulated at 48\,h in goethite, indicating the initial adaptation of the cells to minerals. A model was proposed to describe the effects of goethite on the biofilm formation. Our findings may facilitate a better understanding of the roles of soil clays in biofilm development and the manipulation of bacterial compositions through controlling the biofilm in soils. The effect of three soil minerals on biofilm production is clarified by research using the common soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The mineral composition of soil is known to affect biofilm production, but the mechanisms underpinning minerals' influences have not been well studied. Peng Cai and colleagues at Huazhong Agricultural University in China, with co-workers in the United States and Singapore, studied Bacillus subtilis growing in the presence of the minerals montmorillonite, kaolinite, and goethite. Their results suggest the minerals, especially goethite, can encourage biofilm formation by promoting the bursting of bacterial cells. The effect of goethite was attributed to the size of its grains being generally smaller than the bacterial cells. By quantifying the effect of these minerals, the research will assist understanding of biofilm formation and the growth and persistence of bacterial populations in soils.},

Low concentrations of NPs (0.5\textendash 30~mg L-1) significantly promoted bacterial growth and biofilm formation, while higher concentrations ({$>$}30~mg L-1) significantly inhibited biofilm formation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that microscope slides coated with 0.5~mg L-1 of ZnO NPs showed enhanced bacterial colonization and biomass production, but at higher concentrations (250~mg L-1), biomass production was about 11 times lower than that of the substrate without NPs. Increased protein and sugar contents of the biofilm matrix corroborated the stimulating effects of low concentrations of ZnO NPs. Physiological data were supported by changes in the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress and biofilm development. ZnO NPs at 0.5~mg L-1 stimulated the expression of quorum sensing, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and antibiotic resistance genes; high concentrations of ZnO NPs (250~mg L-1) down-regulated biofilm formation-related genes and up-regulated antioxidant genes. Our results indicate that long-term release of low concentrations of ZnO NPs to the environment would promote undesired biofilm formation and increased resistance to antibiotics.},

  abstract = {The effects of humic acid (HA) on interactions between ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 biofilms at different maturity stages were investigated. Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the ATP content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90\% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. However, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the ATP content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn2+ originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn2+ on HA. The combined results from this work suggest that the biofilm maturity stages and environmental constituents (such as humic acid) are important factors to consider when evaluating potential risks of NPs to ecological systems.},

However, such a topic has not been well investigated; hence, this study was designed to explore the interactions of NOM, NPs, and bacteria in a model system and, specifically, the influence of surface-bound humic acid (HA) on the toxicity of hematite NPs to Pseudomonas putida. Results showed that pure hematite NPs could inhibit the bacterial growth with a median lethal concentration (24 h LC50) of 23.58 mg L-1, while surface-bound HA could significantly mitigate the toxicity of hematite with the highest LC50 of 4774.23 mg L-1, which were corroborated by the transcriptional regulation of Pseudomonas putida cell activity-related genes. Co-precipitation experiments and transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that surfacebound HA prevented the adhesion of hematite to the cells and limited cell internalization. Compared to hematite NPs, the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of oxidative stress genes were significantly inhibited in hematite surface-bound HA systems. The prevention of adhesion and inhibition of ROS production could account for the HA-mitigated nanotoxicity. Interfacial interactions between hematite and bacteria were also evaluated on the basis of the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, suggesting that the more adhesive conditions resulted in greater toxicity and the more repulsive conditions resulted in a reduced toxicity of the model microorganism. The results of this study serve as a platform to better understand the interactions between bacteria or bacterial biofilms and minerals in the natural environment.},

In this paper, the C60/C3N4 and C70/C3N4 hybrids were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV\textendash vis DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high revolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The performance of photocatalytic disinfection was investigated by the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Both C60/C3N4 and C70/C3N4 hybrids showed similar crystalline structure and morphology with C3N4; however, the two composites exhibited stronger bacterial inactivation than C3N4. In particular, C70/C3N4 showed the highest bactericidal efficiency and was detrimental to all E. coli O157:H7 in 4 h irradiation. Compared to C3N4, the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of composites could be attributed to the effective transfer of the photoinduced electrons under visible light irradiation. Owing to the excellent performance of fullerenes (C60, C70)/C3N4 composites, a visible light response and environmental friendly photocatalysts for disinfection were achieved.},

  abstract = {Background Bacterial biofilms are surface-adherent microbial communities in which individual cells are surrounded by a self-produced extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and proteins. Interactions among matrix components within biofilms are responsible for creating an adaptable structure during biofilm development. However, it is unclear how the interactions among matrix components contribute to the construction of the three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architecture. Results DNase I treatment significantly inhibited Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation in the early phases of biofilm development. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis revealed that eDNA was cooperative with exopolysaccharide (EPS) in the early stages of B. subtilis biofilm development, while EPS played a major structural role in the later stages. In addition, deletion of the EPS production gene epsG in B. subtilis SBE1 resulted in loss of the interaction between EPS and eDNA and reduced the biofilm biomass in pellicles at the air-liquid interface. The physical interaction between these two essential biofilm matrix components was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Conclusions Biofilm 3D structures become interconnected through surrounding eDNA and EPS. eDNA interacts with EPS in the early phases of biofilm development, while EPS mainly participates in the maturation of biofilms. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the role of the interaction between eDNA and EPS in shaping the biofilm 3D matrix structure and biofilm formation.},

Humic-acid equivalent (HAE) was used as an indicator for extracellular contamination and ATP for quantifying intracellular contamination from cell lysis. Among the tested methods, CER resulted in EPS extraction with minimal contamination. Therefore, we propose that CER is currently the most appropriate method for extraction of EPS from Ultisols.},

This study looks at the construction of a global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, based on a high-throughput bacterial two-hybrid method. Almost the entire ORFeome was cloned, and more than 8000 novel interactions were identified. The overall quality of the PPI network was validated through two independent methods, and a high success rate of more than 60\% was obtained. The parameters of PPI networks were calculated. The average shortest path length was 4.31. The topological coefficient of the M. tuberculosis B2H network perfectly followed a power law distribution (correlation = 0.999; R-squared = 0.999) and represented the best fit in all currently available PPI networks. A cross-species PPI network comparison revealed 94 conserved subnetworks between M. tuberculosis and several prokaryotic organism PPI networks. The global network was linked to the protein secretion pathway. Two WhiB-like regulators were found to be highly connected proteins in the global network. This is the first systematic noncomputational PPI data for the human pathogen, and it provides a useful resource for studies of infection mechanisms, new signaling pathways, and novel antituberculosis drug development.},

The genome houses 44 gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, in which 20 gene clusters are involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides and nonribosomally synthesized peptides. High-throughput sequencing was further performed and genetic variants were identified from pooled libraries consisting of the 30 highest-yield mutants or 30 lowest-yield mutants. More than 350 genetic variants associated with {$\epsilon$}-PL yield have been identified. One hundred sixty-two affected proteins, from important metabolic enzymes to novel transcriptional regulators, were identified as being related to {$\epsilon$}-PL synthesis. HrdD, one of the affected genes, is a sigma factor that shows the most sensitive response to pH change and contains a non-synonymous mutation (A132V) in mutant strains with lower {$\epsilon$}-PL yields. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the pls gene is likely regulated by transcriptional activator HrdD. The data obtained in this study will facilitate future studies on {$\epsilon$}-PL yield improvement and industrial bioprocess optimization.},

Our results showed that extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production was significantly enhanced and micro-meter sized cell aggregates formed with high glucose amendment. Biofilm development exhibited significant effects on the soil microbial processes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the soils with biofilms and free-living cells shared similar microbial communities. But the Shannon diversity and evenness indices of communities with soil biofilms were significantly enhanced by 18.2\% and 17.1\%. The soil with biofilms also revealed a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which consumed 65.4\% more oxygen in the topsoil (0\textendash 1.5\,mm). Kinetic respiration analysis showed that the enhanced metabolic activity was attributed to 23-times more active microbes in soil biofilms. In summary, this study revealed that soil biofilms can sustain a diverse and robust community to drive soil biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {It is urgent to understand the regulatory mechanism of drug resistance in widespread bacterial pathogens. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, several transcriptional regulators have been found to play essential roles in regulating its drug resistance. In this study, we found that an ArsR family transcription regulator encoded by Rv2642 (CdiR) responds to isoniazid (INH), a widely used anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug. CdiR negatively regulates self and adjacent genes, including arsC (arsenic-transport integral membrane protein ArsC). CdiR directly interacts with INH and Cd(II). The binding of INH and Cd(II) both reduce its DNA-binding activity. Disrupting cdiR increased the drug susceptibility to INH, whereas overexpressing cdiR decreased the susceptibility. Strikingly, overexpressing arsC increased the drug susceptibility as well as cdiR. Additionally, both changes in cdiR and arsC expression caused sensitivity to other drugs such as rifamycin and ethambutol, where the minimal inhibitory concentrations in the cdiR deletion strain were equal to those of the arsC-overexpressing strain, suggesting that the function of CdiR in regulating drug resistance primarily depends on arsC. Furthermore, we found that Cd(II) enhances bacterial resistance to INH in a CdiR-dependent manner. As a conclusion, CdiR has a critical role in directing the interplay between Cd(II) metal ions and drug susceptibility in mycobacteria.},

Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, the pathogen responsible for human tuberculosis, contains three RelBE-like modules, RelBE, RelFG, and RelJK, which are at least partly expressed in human macrophages during infection. RelBE modules appear to be autoregulated in an atypical manner compared to other TA systems; however, the molecular mechanisms and potential interactions between different RelBE modules remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we characterized the interaction and cross-regulation of these Rel toxin-antitoxin modules from this unique pathogen. The physical interactions between the three pairs of RelBE proteins were confirmed and the DNA-binding domain recognized by three RelBE-like pairs and domain structure characteristics were described. The three RelE-like proteins physically interacted with the same RelB-like protein, and could conditionally regulate its binding with promoter DNA. The RelBE-like modules exerted complex cross-regulation effects on mycobacterial growth. The relB antitoxin gene could replace relF in cross-neutralizing the relG toxin gene. Conversely, relF enhanced the toxicity of the relE toxin gene, while relB increased the toxicity of relK. This is the first report of interactions between different pairs of RelBE modules of M. tuberculosis.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms of these systems, particularly their interaction with other cellular components, are still poorly understood. This study investigated cross-talk between the TA module RelJ/K (Rv3357/Rv3358) and the transcriptional regulator staphylococcal iron regulator repressor (SirR, Rv2788) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We characterized the physical interaction of SirR with both RelJ and RelK using bacterial two-hybrid, pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Similarly to RelK, SirR regulates the DNA-binding activity of RelJ and alleviates its inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv3357p promoter. Furthermore, SirR may replace RelJ to alleviate the inhibitory effect of the toxin RelK on bacterial growth. Conversely, both RelJ and RelK competitively inhibit the interaction between SirR and their respective promoters. Thus, our results show that SirR interacts with a pair of toxin and antitoxin proteins, and exhibits antitoxin-like function to neutralize the toxin. These findings demonstrate a novel function of the SirR regulator of M. tuberculosis as well as a novel mechanism of regulation of TA systems.},

  abstract = {Isoniazid (INH), an anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug, has been widely used for nearly 60 years. However, the pathway through which Mycobacterium tuberculosis responds INH remain largely unclear. In this study, we characterized a novel transcriptional factor, InbR, which is encoded by Rv0275c and belongs to the TetR family, that is directly responsive to INH. Disrupting inbR made mycobacteria more sensitive to INH, whereas overexpressing inbR decreased bacterial susceptibility to the drug. InbR could bind specifically to the upstream region of its own operon at two inverted repeats and act as an auto-repressor. Furthermore, InbR directly bind with INH, and the binding reduced InbR's DNA-binding ability. Interestingly, susceptibilities were also changed by InbR for other anti-TB drugs, such as rifampin, implying that InbR may play a role in multi-drug resistance. Additionally, microarray analyses revealed a portion genes of the inbR regulon have similar expression patterns in inbR-overexpressing strain and INH-treated wild type strain, suggesting that these genes, for example iniBAC, may be responsible to the drug resistance of inbR-overexpressing strain. The regulation of these genes by InbR were further assessed by ChIP-seq assay. InbR may regulate multiple drug resistance of mycobacteria through the regulation of these genes.},

However, only a few transcription factors that regulate drug resistance have been characterized in mycobacteria. In this study, a TetR family transcriptional factor (OxiR), encoded by Rv0067c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was found to be an isoniazid (INH) resistance regulator. Comparing with the wild-type strain, the oxiR overexpressing strain is four times resistant to INH, whereas the oxiR knockout strain is eight times sensitive to INH. However, the rifamycin and ethambutol resistance were not influenced by oxiR. OxiR can bind to self-promoter at a 66 bp imperfect palindromic motifs. Interestingly, OxiR directly binds to INH, and thereby alleviate the self-repression. Furthermore, OxiR negatively regulated an oxidoreductase encoded by Rv0068. And the susceptibility of the Rv0068-overexpressing and oxiR knockout strains to all the three above-mentioned anti-tuberculosis drugs was equivalent, suggesting that the effect of oxiR to INH susceptibility is attributed to the derepression of Rv0068. In conclusion, we showed that OxiR can specifically modulate INH susceptibility by regulating an oxidoreductase encoding gene, both of which have not been associated with drug-resistance previously.},

However, the key transcriptional factors involved in broad regulation of diverse genes remain to be characterized in mycobacteria. In the present study, a TetR-like family transcriptional factor, Ms6564, was characterized in M. smegmatis as a master regulator. A conserved 19 bp-palindromic motif was identified for Ms6564 binding using DNaseI footprinting and EMSA. A total of 339 potential target genes for Ms6564 were further characterized by searching the M. smegmatis genome based on the sequence motif. Notably, Ms6564 bound with the promoters of 37 cell cycle and DNA damage/repair genes and regulated positively their expressions. The Ms6564-overexpressed recombinant strain yielded 5-fold lower mutation rates and mutation frequencies, whereas deletion of Ms6564 resulted in {$\sim$}5-fold higher mutation rates for the mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain. These findings suggested that Ms6564 may function as a global regulator and might be a sensor necessary for activation of DNA damage/repair genes.},

However, the proteins essential for the coordination of origin selection and the functioning of DNA polymerase have not yet been characterized in archaea, and they are still being investigated in eukaryotes. In the current study, the Orc1/Cdc6 (SsoCdc6) proteins from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus were found to physically interact with its DNA polymerase B1 (SsoPolB1). These SsoCdc6 proteins stimulated the DNA-binding ability of SsoPolB1 and differentially regulated both its polymerase and nuclease activities. Furthermore, the proteins also mutually regulated their interactions with SsoPolB1. In addition, SsoPolB1c467, a nuclease domain-deleted mutant of SsoPolB1 defective in DNA binding, retains the ability to physically interact with SsoCdc6 proteins. Its DNA polymerase activity could be stimulated by these proteins. We report on a linkage between the initiator protein Orc1/Cdc6 and DNA polymerase in the archaeon. Our present and previous findings indicate that archaeal Orc1/Cdc6 proteins could potentially play critical roles in the coordination of origin selection and cell-cycle control of replication.},

  abstract = {Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) exuded by microbes are found in diverse habitats, including soil. The quantification and characterization of EPS are essential prerequisites for understanding the ecological functions of extracellular products in soil. However, few studies have conducted in-depth profiling of soil EPS extraction steps and chemical characteristics. Here we examine the C and N contents, biopolymer contents, and optical properties of EPS involving three soil pre-treatment methods (moist soil, moist soil pre-incubated, and air-dried soil pre-incubated) and simultaneously track the compositional changes during the two-step extraction process (extract with CaCl2 in Step 1 and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with cation exchange resin (CER) in Step 2). The optical properties of soil EPS are investigated using ultraviolet-visible adsorption (UV\textendash Vis), excitation-emission-matrix fluorescence (EEM), and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analytical methods such as parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation analysis. Results show that Step 2 releases significantly more dissolved organic carbon and biopolymers (polysaccharides, proteins, and uronic acids) from soils. UV\textendash Vis and EEM spectroscopy suggest that the fractions extracted in Step 2 exhibit higher mean aromaticity, molecular weight, and humification degree than those extracted in Step 1. When using the standard method to extract EPS from moist aggregates (Step 2), EPS has a distinct fluorescence profile, rich in tryptophan- and tyrosine-like signals. Reassuringly, the fluorescence-profiles found in pre-extracts (Step 1) are very different - except where i) aggregates have an experimental drying step added, and ii) pure water is used as a pre-extractant. Drying of aggregates is thus problematic, and the use of pure water as an alternative pre-extractant is not advisable. Soil treatments have significant effects on the qualities of the various extracts which are detected by both the FTIR-PCA and EEM-PCA analyses. EEM fluorescence profiles of EPS suggest that both tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances are key components of the EPS extracted from all soils regardless of pretreatment. Our findings indicate that chemical characterization of soil EPS combined with spectral-chemometric approaches can be applied to identify and characterise the extracellular responses of soil microbes and thus help reveal the ecological functions of extracellular products in soils.},

  abstract = {The multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) plays an important role in modulating bacterial antibiotic resistance. However, the regulatory model of the marRAB operon in mycobacteria remains to be characterized. Here we report that a MarR, encoded by Ms6508, and its marRAB operon specifically contribute to rifampicin (RIF) resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We show that the MarR recognizes a conserved 21-bp palindromic motif and negatively regulates the expression of two ABC transporters in the operon, encoded by Ms6509-6510. Unlike other known drug efflux pumps, overexpression of these two ABC transporters unexpectedly increased RIF sensitivity and deletion of these two genes increased mycobacterial resistance to the antibiotic. No change can be detected for the sensitivity of recombinant mycobacterial strains to three other anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, HPLC experiments suggested that Ms6509-Ms6510 could pump RIF into the mycobacterial cells. These findings indicated that the mycobacterial MarR functions as a repressor and constitutively inhibits the expression of the marRAB operon, which specifically contributes to RIF resistance in M. smegmatis. Therefore, our data suggest a new regulatory mechanism of RIF resistance and also provide the new insight into the regulatory model of a marRAB operon in mycobacteria.},
